## 📖 About This Bootcamp

Welcome to my 21-day intensive journey into Object-Oriented Programming! This repository documents my daily progress, code exercises, and projects as I master the fundamental and advanced concepts of OOP.

### 🎯 Goals

- Master the four pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction
- Build real-world applications using OOP principles
- Develop clean, maintainable, and scalable code
- Complete daily coding challenges and projects
- Document learnings and best practices

3. **Polymorphism** 🎭
   - Method overloading
   - Dynamic method dispatch
   - Runtime polymorphism

4. **Abstraction** 🎨
   - Abstract classes
   - Interfaces
   - Hiding implementation details
